# Vega Research

Vega is a bespoke blockchain designed for decentralised trading. It operates as a public sidechain to major collateral chains and is designed for high speed trading of derivatives. Please refer to our whitepaper for more background details: [https://vega.xyz/background#published-papers](https://vega.xyz/background#published-papers).

As it's a first attempt (that we know of) at creating a professional grade system with such characteristics it faces research problems that are often specific to that setting and interdisciplinary in nature. The main disciplines that our research spans include Computer Science, Mathematics and Economics.

## Vega's Research Agenda

The issues in this repo capture our research agenda. We outline some concrete research problems that we're either dealing with at the moment or have on our roadmap. We hope that this will allow us to open up to the broader research community and facilitate meaningful collaborations.

## Current key areas

- Blockchains designed for trading
- Gaming and attacks
- Quantitative risk and calibration
