# Self governance in a blockchain

Community thread: TODO

GitHub issue: TODO

## Description

While the progression of a blockchain is usually well distributed among a number of validators,
the factors that cover governance - setting various operational parameters, performing updates in the code or the algorithms, etc - are often far less distributed. To make things worse, many decisions cannot be voted on by the same structures the validators use - for example, validators might have an economic interest in keeping other validators out, and thus should not be responsible for membership decisions. Another issue is voting competence - some stakeholders may be in just as an investment and have little motivation to obtain all the knowledge needed for a competent vote. Other decisions that a self-governing blockchain needs to be able to make include for example

- The reward scheme: how are validators paied in a way that keeps them motivated to do their job,
without increasing the transaction cost or motivating validators to be too big or too small ?
How can we avoid validators to do a good job and not try to get away getting paied for the minimum
work possible ?
- Validator Membership: How can we keep a validator set of validators that have sufficient performance,
are well distributed, and can't end up having a monopoly that can dictate prices ?
- Code updates: When and how is the implementation changed in a way that there is no single entity
dictating the code and while avoiding hard forks ?
- Runntime parameters, such as timeouts

**Research Question:** For above questions (as well as more that are still identified), propose a voting setting in which all decisions are made by voters that have both the competency and the interest to make decisions that are in the best interest of a robust and well decentralised blockchain. (It might be a good starting point to give a good definition what that actually is).
