# GitHub pages test

## What's this about

The idea is to publish a public GitHub page from a private `research` repo. I want to target a specific folder `PUBLIC_DOCS` on a specific branch `PUBLIC` to make it fairly hard for us to expose something that we don't want to. Ideally I'd like to make it password protected too.
