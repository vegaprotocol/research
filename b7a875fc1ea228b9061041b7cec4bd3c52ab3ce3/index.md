# GitHub pages test

## What's this about

The idea is to publish a public GitHub page from a private `research` repo. ~~I want to target a specific folder `PUBLIC_DOCS` on a specific branch `PUBLIC`~~ I'm targetting `gh-pages` branch to make it fairly hard for us to expose something that we don't want to (other options where `master` or `docs` folder on `master`, but this seemed safest).
